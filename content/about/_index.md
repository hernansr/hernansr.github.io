In 2004 I began frequenting a small internet café located near my house due to the absence of a personal computer. Over time, I started assisting other customers who were unfamiliar with computers. A few months after, I became the IT technician, and the first thing I did was upgrading the 8 computers from Windows ME to Windows XP.

Between 2008 and 2015 I provided IT services to a range of clients in the Guadalajara area, including government, global corporations, as well as micro and small businesses.

Notable achievement:
